As a traveler, I want to know the current weather of the next city I visit.

As a runner, I need to know if I should wear a raincoat on my morning run in the city I'm visiting.

As a dog owner, I would like to have access to the current weather in my city, just in case it's too cold to take my dog for a walk.
